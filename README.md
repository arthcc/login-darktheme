# Login Page: Dark Mode

## :memo: Description: 
Sign In page using HTML and CSS, for training purposes. With this project, I could learn how HTML and CSS work together, and I also tried to learn more about UI/UX and understand more Front-End technologies. I want to improve more, I´ve been thinking how I want the whole project to be. 


## :wrench: Technologies I used in this project:
* HTML and CSS

## :soon: What I wanna do next?
* I´m planning to make the 'Sign Up' page and the whole website.
So if a person selects  "Click Here to make an account" they can create the account. I want to make this page to work as real as possible. 
* Wanna Add JavaScript to this project
* Maybe working with a Weather API, so I could make a "Main Page" and add the Weather Card, which will access the User Real-Time location and show the temperature.
